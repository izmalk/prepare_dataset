# Preparing a dataset

I have downloaded [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/saurabhbagchi/books-dataset) with some users, books and book ratings.
It was too large so I have optimised it for example purposes. Initially I have left about 800 books and parsed all users and ratings for these books. But there were too much ratings and some encoding problems. So I have furhter filtered the dataset.

All scripts are in python directory.

All datasets are in python/data directory.

Final result that will be used for example:

- books_lite.csv
- users_lite3.csv
- ratings_lite3.csv
